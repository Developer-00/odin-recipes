    <h2>How to Make Lasagna</h2>
    <p> For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick,
        meaty tomato sauce and layering that with noodles 
        and cheese into a casserole. Here's the run-down: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Â½ to 2 pounds bulk Italian sausage</li>
        <li>Neutral oil, as needed</li>
        <li>1 onion, small dice</li>
        <li>1 bell pepper, medium dice (the color of your choice)</li>
        <li>2 to 4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
        <li> Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
        <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
    </ol>
